## Overview

The concept of zero has existed for ages, but two mathematicians from India decided to put that concept into a number.

Then Zero existed.

However, as with many other things, a discovery comes with many other questions.

What happens when we divide _any_ number by Zero?

## In mathematics

In mathematics, dividing a number by zero would be undefined, since a number broken into zero groups would mean the number would just cease to exist.

## In physics

In physics however, since when a number is divided by another number, as the value of the second number decreases,the result _increases_.

Therefore a number divided by zero would be infinity.

## Conclusion 

I really don't know what I'm supposed to conclude here. 

Bye.
