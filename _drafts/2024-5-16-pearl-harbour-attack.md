This eventually led to the US joining the war the following day.

For a long time, the US stayed well away from the world war going on right outside their continent, while the US continued to sell weapons to the Alies (or practically everyone involved).\
They invested their time and money into building and developing weapons to sell.

However after Pearl Harvour went down in History, the US started a massive military build up to prepare themselves for World War 2.

## Why Japan attacked

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour, they knew they were messing with a powerful country that they probably couldn't beat.
