This eventually led to the US joining the war the following day.

For a long time, the US stayed well away from the world war going on right outside their continent, while the US continued to sell weapons to the Alies (or practically everyone involved).\
They invested their time and money into building and developing weapons to sell.

However after Pearl Harvour went down in History, the US started a massive military build up to prepare themselves for World War 2.

## Why Japan attacked

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour, they knew they were messing with a powerful country that they probably couldn't beat.

Then why attack?

First we must look into Japan's motive.

At that current point in time, Japan was a militaristic and authoritarian country, ever since the Meji Restoration, it has set out on conquering land for itself.

In WW2, the US were a major obstacle in their conquest. Since the US had a Pacific Fleet, the Japanese could have wanted to rid any sort of potential resistance against them in the Pacific or in Asia.

One main feature of the fleet (US) was thei aircraft carriers, which the Japanese were hoping to get rid of by attacking the naval base, however the aircraft carriers happened to no be there on that exact day, so their primary objective could not be achieved.

## Conclusion

In the end, the attack was a big fail.\
With the attackers not achieving their goals and bringing the US into the war (directly).
