# Tutorial Post

This is for anyone who wishes to write on Scripta Mirabilla

Prerequisites:
- a github account
- basic markdown knowledge

---

1. You'll need to navigate to the repo for this site on Github, then go to `_posts` folder, you will see all the past posts already on there.

2. Fork the repository if you aren't a member of the organisation
   
3. If you happen to be a member, remember to use the `_drafts` folder to construct your post before moving it over to `_posts`

4. Create a new file and name it `*year*-*month*-*day*-*nameofpost*.md`, make sure it is under the folder `_posts`
   
5. You will need to put in the `layout, title, author and tags` parameters before continuing.
   
   - Follow the template for the parameters:

  ```
      ---
     
      layout: post #required
     
      title: "*post title, can be anything*" #required
     
      author: "*your name*" #required
     
      tags: #eg. 'story' for story posts
     
      ---
  ```

4. Now you can add in the contents of your post in Markdown, HTML is also supported.
   
5. Finally, press 'commit changes' and wait for Github to serve it onto the site.
   
6. If you didn't have access to the main repository, you can use a pull request, we will review and accept.

7. If everything goes well, your post will appear on the site!
