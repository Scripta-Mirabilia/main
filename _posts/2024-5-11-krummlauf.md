## Overview

The krummlauf was a gun attatchment invented by the Germans during World War II, it included a periscope to help with aiming. Why you may ask?

Because the attatchment allowed the gun to fire sideways.\
The krummlauf could angle bullets at a 30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees depending on the attatchment, however this significantly reduced its durability due to the amount of stress on that attatchment itself.

The Soviet Union later tried to adopt this strategy.
